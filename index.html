When you create a website, its files need to be stored on a server, which is a specialized computer. Web hosting companies provide the infrastructure and services necessary for hosting, renting out server space or resources. Once your website files are uploaded to the server, anyone with an internet connection can access it using your domain name. Hosting providers ensure your website is available 24/7, handle data transfers, manage server security, and offer technical support. There are various types of hosting, each catering to different website needs. In essence, hosting enables websites to be accessed and viewed by visitors through the internet.</div>

                        <div class="accordion-body">Web hosting works by storing and serving website files on powerful servers connected to the internet. When you sign up for a hosting service, you rent server space from a hosting provider. You then upload your website files to this server, which becomes accessible via your domain name. When visitors enter your domain name into a web browser, their request is routed to the hosting server. The server retrieves the requested files and delivers them to the visitor's browser, enabling them to view your website. Hosting providers ensure the server is continuously operational, manage data transfers, and provide necessary security measures. In summary, web hosting involves storing website files on servers and making them available for access, allowing visitors to view the website through their browsers.</div>

                          <div class="accordion-body">The main difference between a domain and hosting lies in their respective roles in establishing a website's online presence. A domain is the unique web address that people type into their browsers to access a website (e.g., www.example.com). It serves as a user-friendly identifier for your website. On the other hand, hosting refers to the service that provides the infrastructure and resources necessary to store and make your website accessible on the internet. Hosting involves renting server space where your website's files, such as HTML, CSS, images, and databases, are stored. In simpler terms, a domain is like your website's address, while hosting is the physical space where your website's content resides. Both domain and hosting are crucial components for a website, with the domain providing the address and hosting enabling the website to be accessed and viewed online.</div>
